                                    Inspections are a very important part of any housing assistance program. The standards that are set by HUD and USDA ensure that your home will be in safe, decent and sanitary condition. There are two different types of inspections. Public Housing, Affordable Housing and USDA/Rural Development have inspections that follow the Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS) and the Housing Choice Voucher Program.s inspection follows the guideline of the Housing Quality Standards Inspection (HQS).

                                    Each inspection type has requirements that are the Owner.s responsibility and the Tenant.s responsibility. It is important to make yourself aware of your responsibilities to ensure that the unit that you rent stays in safe, decent and sanitary condition. Inspections make certain that the unit meets the minimum standards for rental properties and that there are no health and safety concerns that could affect the participant.
                                </p>

                                    Below you will find the top deficiencies that are found in each inspection type. Anytime you discover a problem in your unit, always report the problem to your landlord as a soon as possible. Prolonged deficiencies can in some cases cause a delay in housing assistance. The .A Good Place to Live. brochure is an excellent tool in providing useful information about things to look for in your unit that could be a potential problem. Proper care of the unit by the Tenant and proper maintenance by the Landlord will keep the unit in the best condition possible which means a better place to call home.
